NameGenerator
-------------

Creates an output file of randomized first and last names - mix of male and female.
<br>
<br>
Firstnames dictionary approx 3900 records, with lastnames dictionary approx 150, giving 500,000 possible combinations.
<br>
<br>
Useful for populating databases, provisioning systems, HR systems etc.  I use it along with HRGenerator, EventGenerator and AxSGenerator
<br>
<br>
Dictionaries in lib/dictionaries can obviously be replaced / modified.  Hard code the number of names to create in globals section.
<br>
<br>
10,000 names takes less than 10 secs on a x86-64 8gb Linux machine.
