NameGenerator
-------------

Creates an output file of randomized first and last names.  Mix of male and female.
<br/>
Firstnames dictionary approx 3900 record with lastnames dictionary approx 150, giving 1/2million possible combinations.
<br/>
Useful for populating databases, provisioning systems, HR systems etc.  I use it along with HRGenerator, EventGenerator and AxSGenerator
<br/>
Use as-if, no warranty.  Fork, copy, distribute, with attribution in place.
<br/>
Dictionaries in lib/dictionaries can obviously be replaced / modified.  Hard code the number of names to create in globals section.
<br/>
10,000 names takes less than 10secs on x86-64 8gb Linux machine.
